                <h2>What is this course about?</h2>
                <p>
                    Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA) is the lens through which we understand how complex problems are broken into simple, elegant steps. It nurtures a mindset of curiosity: **Why does nature optimize paths?** How can we model real-world challenges mathematically? This course transforms logic and mathematics into a powerful bridge for real-world problem-solving.
                </p>

                <h2>How do we connect it to real-time applications?</h2>
                <p>
                    Algorithms guide almost every digital moment: search engine predictions, traffic routing, and fraud detection. From healthcare diagnostics to social media feeds, algorithms shape decisions at speeds the human mind cannot match. DAA helps us see these **invisible, structured logic processes**, understand how they scale, and appreciate how simple ideas support millions of people globally.

        <h2>About Bellasagaram City</h2>
        <div class="city-description-box">
            <p>
                Bellasagaram, meaning “The Sweet Coastal City,” is a newly proposed urban development inspired by the rich heritage and natural potential of Anakapalli, Andhra Pradesh. The name fuses "Bellam" (jaggery/agricultural identity) and "Sagara" (sea/coastal growth). The vision is to transform the area into a **sustainable, smart, and economically vibrant coastal city** that preserves culture while embracing progress.
            </p>
            <p>
                The development model focuses on the integration of **ports, fisheries, recycling industries, cold storage, and solar energy systems**. Utilizing its coastal advantage, the city aims to boost exports, generate employment, and attract investments. Solar-powered operations and marine-based industries create a self-sustaining revenue ecosystem, establishing Bellasagaram as a model **marine-industrial hub** where industry, environment, and livelihood thrive together.
